# ECED 4402 - Real-Time Systems Lab Base Code

This repository contains the base code for the labs in the ECED 4402 Real-Time Systems course. The code is designed for the STM32F411RE development board and is built using FreeRTOS for task management and real-time scheduling.

The repository includes the foundational setup for:
- Using FreeRTOS on the STM board

I will build upon this base code to implement the various lab exercises, demonstrating my understanding of real-time task management, synchronization, and resource sharing on embedded systems.

## Requirements
- STM32CubeIDE
- STM32F411RE Development Board
- FreeRTOS

## Getting Started
1. Clone this repository.
2. Import the project into STM32CubeIDE.
